# Casa-nyc
Casa-nyc is a website that helps individuals who have recently immigrated to the US, specifically New York City navigate the different resources that are available to them. Users can find these resources in this website that serves as a hub and can filter based on preferences. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Casa-nyc](https://github.com/aaviles-alonso/casa-nyc).

Description
Relocating to a new country can be a an amazing experience but it also comes with it challenges too, including loneliness. Many nomads struggle to meet new people when they reach their new location, leading to feeling lonely. SALUT was created to solve this problem by providing a platform for nomads to connect with others who share similar interests.

Lessons learned and next steps
In creating this website, creating my own API was the most time consuming aspect of the project, therefore I may have not put as much dedication to functinality ie:more filter options in each resource. I had difficulty being able to have the back-end data show on the front-end of the website as well. 
My next steps, would be creating a provider side to the website and a user side. This would make it so that people who add resources to the website are not spam users and are people who want to advertise their organization or service. Another next-step would be to add a filter by zip code so that users can find resource closest to the zipcode they enter into the website, A final next step would be finding an API that could translate the entire website into any given language that the user so chooses.
